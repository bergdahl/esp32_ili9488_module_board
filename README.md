# esp32_ili9488_module_board

> This is a work in progress. 

This is a simple ESP32 based board for the _3.5" TFT SPI 480X320_ module. It is powered by 5V over a 
micro USB connector, and has footprints both for ESP-WROOM-32 and ESP_VROVER-32.

I designed the board primarily for use with [Dustin Watt's FreeTouchDeck firmware](https://github.com/DustinWatts/FreeTouchDeck).

Programming is done using an external FTDI232 board.

## PCB files

I have added the Gerber files in the `PCB/Gerber` folder, just zip and upload to your favorite PCB manufacturer.

I have also included the EAGLE design files if you need to modify the design for yoyr needs.
